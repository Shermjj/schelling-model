    "Schelling's Model was one of the seminal works of agent based modelling in the social sciences, and we will attempt to recreate this model below.\n",
    "In the model, the agents are differentiated based on race, of which there are two kinds. The agents will attempt to optimize their satisfaction ratio,\n",
    "which is given by the ratio of neighbours with the same race divided by the total number of neighbours.\n",
    "Hence, the agents will congregate towards neighbourhoods with people of the same race.\n",

    ", with a population density of 0.75 person per square units. We will randomly allocate a race to the agents. And finally, we will assign a satisfaction ratio of 0.5 to the agents.\n",
